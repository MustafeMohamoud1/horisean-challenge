# horisean-challenge

The horisean-challenge was my first weekly assignment as part of this 6 month Coding course. For this weeks challenge we had an On-the-job ticket which means we were given starter code in a folder called Develop, that we then had to modify/refactor as part of the challenge. The horisean-challenge was created with one very important aspect of web development in mind which is, accessebility, therefore we had to improve the code for the website to improve it's accessibility whilst also ensuring it functions correctly and retains the same initial design/look.

We had to refactor the existing code that we were given in the HTML so it met the following accessebility standards:

1 - The source code had to contain semantic html elements
2 - The HTML elements had to follow a logical structure independant of styling and positioning
3 - The icon and image elements had to contain accessible alt attributes
4 - The heading attributes had to go down in sequential order
5 - The webpage had to be given a concise and descriptive title element
6 - Application's links all function correctly.

Below are screenshots of the changes I made to the HTML so it met these requirments:

Once these HTML requirements were met I could move onto the next step of this project (technical acceptance) which involved modifying the css stylesheet. For this part of the task I had to go into the style.css and improve the code to insure it met the following criteria:

1 - The CSS selectors and properties need to be consolidated and organized to follow semantic structure 
2 - CSS file must be properly commented

Here are some before and after screenshots of the changes I made to the CSS file:

Once all of the editing was finally done in the HTML and CSS I had to deploy the website at a live URL using Github pages and ensure it loaded and functioned correctly whilst still maintaining the original website design. Here below is a link to my deployed website:
