# horisean-challenge

The horisean-challenge was my first weekly assignment as part of this 6 month Coding course. For this weeks challenge we had an On-the-job ticket which means we were given starter code in a folder called Develop, that we then had to modify/refactor as part of the challenge. The horisean-challenge was created with one very important aspect of web development in mind which is, accessebility. 

We had to refactor the existing code that we were given in the HTML so it met the following accessebility standards:

1 - The source code had to contain semantic html elements
2 - The HTML elements had to follow a logical structure independant of styling and positioning
3 - The icon and image elements had to contain accessible alt attributes
4 - The heading attributes had to go down in sequential order
5 - The webpage had to be given a concise and descriptive title element

Below are screenshots of the changes I made to the HTML so it met these requirments:

![Alt text](assets/html%20after.png)


Once these HTML requirements were met I could move onto the next step of this project which involved modifying the css stylesheet.
