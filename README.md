# horisean-challenge

Insight into the challenge:
The horisean-challenge was my first weekly assignment as part of this 6 month Coding course. For this weeks challenge we were given an On-the-job ticket which means we were given starter code in a folder called Develop, which we then had to modify or refactor as part of the challenge. The horisean-challenge was created with one very important aspect of web development in mind whioch is, accessebility.
